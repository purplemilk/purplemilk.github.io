Notes from my phone:

its 3:38am 
and i'm laughing through tears
your art was so boring
your emotions were stunted
you exusted as a platform
i grew gardens around you, 
even in the deep despair in my head
you grew resentment,
its FUNNY baby, laugh! laugh!

*/*

here is the lonely hum in my brain 
where your name used to be
here is your promise of staying
here is the body that loved you
here are all of those drunk texts
here is all the longing
here is all the hollow
here are all of the "i love you"s 
here is the shocking wreck of it all
here is not knowing whether you 
loved me or not 
here is the poem that can't save us
here is me moving on, sad but growing
here is me recognizing you finally 
for who you actually are
here are all of the memories from
the last five years
here is the adoration, burnt up
here are all of your empty words, 
and me, now smiling
here is me, thanking you for giving up
*/*
