Notes from my phone:

3:38am
i'm drunk and your art was never interesting

*/*

here is the lonely hum in my brain where 
your name used to be
here is your promise of staying
here are all of those drunk texts
here are all of the "i love you"s 
here is the shocking wreck of it all
here is not knowing whether you loved me or not 
here is the poem that can't save us
here is me moving on, sad but growing
here is me seeing you for the very first time
here are the things i never wanted to see
here is the realization
here is the adoration, burnt up, hollow
here are the memories we made
here is me, moving towards indifference
here is me, thanking you for giving up
*/*
