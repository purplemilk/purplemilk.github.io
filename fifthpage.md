Notes from my phone:

here is the lonely hum in my brain 
where your name used to be
here is your promise of staying
here is the body that loved you
here are all of those drunk texts
here is all the longing
here is all the hollow
here are all of the "i love you"s 
here is the shocking wreck of it all
here is not knowing whether you 
loved me or not 
here is the poem that can't save us

*/*

i miss sex, with you
i miss our friends
i miss drinking, with you
i don't , though
miss anything else... but
i really miss the sex
