_*/i don't feel this way anymore entirely
i got a 25/25 in my poetry class for this..however_*//

Good bye! Awful love, goodbye! 
You vile cretin, annoying fly 
I’ve had it with your awful lies
Be gone, forever, our love is dry

Your vile thoughts prick my brain
The happy hum that replaced your name
Lowly, you sit in despair, for shame!
You awful love, your name is in vain

Goodbye! You awful love indeed;
So lucky was I to be your need
So silly to think I’d follow your lead
Goodbye awful love, don’t remember me.
