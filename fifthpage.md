Notes from my phone:

here is the lonely hum in my brain 
where your name used to be
here is your promise of staying
here is the body that loved you
here are all of those drunk texts
here is all the longing
here is all the hollow
here are all of the "i love you"s 
here is the shocking wreck of it all
here is not knowing whether you 
loved me or not 
here is the poem that can't save us

*/*

save me though i wish to rest
though i know this for the best
i lie awake and hold my chest

*/*

indifference:
because anger is still feeding
the image of you 
engaved in the back of my eyelids
indifference is the happiness
at the end of all this 
stupid fucking bullshit

*/*

i hope you mention this in passing to your friends
'i feel so bad, but it had to be done'
i hope you misinterpret every word
i hope you think back to every moment when you 
were mine, over the years s
that one time at that party, outside, around the corner
sneaking secret kisses 
and every moment like it and wonder
i hope you wonder what the fuck i'm even talking about
because maybe even i don't know
