sum of th most boring ppl i know are artists.. u can't expect an 
artist to be this vivacious intriguing being all the time bc
their art is their thoughts yfm. but then theres this beauty in bein
the opposit of ur art. *scribbled out paragraph*
theres also sumthin so fuckin wack about needing to be interesting.
always got 2 be producing art even if its garbage & u fuckin know it
its 1 thing 2 produce a project ur passionate about consistently
but its another thing 2 subject ppl to ur psuedo intellectual garbage
in a desperate attempt to get validation.

i like normal ppl a lot. ppl who dont need to appeal to anyone else &
just fuckin exist like we all should b. i like ppl that make art but 
dont even know they doin it. like most of my classmates, makin these
intricate ass algorithms but still think theyre not talented, cause 
on the real theyre the most interesting ppl i know & always surprise me.
i am continually unimpressed by my own art & find myself 2 be extremely
boring. but i am at a place in my life where im ok w a bit of stagnant 
living 2 get to where i eventually want 2 be. every1 wants to b so special, 
i think trying to be special isnt fun. & no body is really their own person
so why not just not be a nobody for a lil bit. 

idk maybe everyone else knows somethin i dont
