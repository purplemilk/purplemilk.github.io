(;

goodbye! goodbye
don't try to remember me
even on the lavender nights
or when the beer runs out
don't remember me, please
i shiver when you do
your vile thoughts prick
my brain, the happy hum
that replaced your name
please! don't remember me
should you see the swing
of my hips, even should
your garden resemble the 
shades of me, 
do us both a favor!
don't remember me
