oh cretin! sly charming, grotesque€™
be nay offered lowly coitus 
and fucking DIE *-\right here before us


and while i wish you all the best (not now) 
i beg you not to let me rest 
for if i lay my head to sleep
i’d wake and yearn to have you weep
lay at me feet and beg to me 
forgiveness, yes beg to me! i'll
force you to say a little rhyme and
as you say, i’d make you’d whine 
i’d prick you gently on the breast 
then harder, til you bleed to death
