oh cretin! sly charming, grotesque€™
be nay offered lowly coitus 
and fucking DIE *-\right here before us


and while i wish you all the best 
i beg you not to let me rest 
for if i lay my head to sleep
i’d wake and yearn to have you weep
lay at me feet and beg to me 
forgiveness, oh eternity! 
say to me a little rhyme and
as you say, i’d wish you’d whine 
i’d prick you gently on the breast 
then harder, til you bleed to death
