Must he then only live to weep,
Who'd prove his friendship true and deep
By day a lonely shadow creep,
At night-time languish,
In his broken sleep

The lover, if for certain days
His fair one be denied his gaze,
Sinks not in grief and wild amaze,
But, wiser wooer,
He spends the time in writing lays,
And posts them to her.

Farewell, dear friend, and when we meet,
In desert waste or crowded street,
Perhaps before this week shall fleet
I trust to find your heart tomorrow 
In the seat
Of wasting sorrow.
