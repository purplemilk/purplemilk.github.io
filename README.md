For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams 

   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
   
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes 

   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
   
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side 

   Of my darling, my DARLING! My life and my bride, 
   In her sepulchre there by the sea— 
   In her tomb by the sounding sea.
