the lowly, lonely, shadow creep
he sits alone in dismay, convinced!
that what he feels is true and deep

and so that lowly shadow creep
decided a lover he should keep

but the shadow creep, he never knew
the limit of things he could do
then excuse the things he did to you
because his feeling are deep & true

and now, the creep, alone he weeps
his feelings void, not true, not deep
that vile lowly shadow creep
how splendid is his misery to me
