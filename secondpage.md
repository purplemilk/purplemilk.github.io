the lowly, lonely, shadow creep
he sits alone in dismay, convinced!
that what he feels is true and deep

and so that lowly shadow creep
decided a lover he should keep

the creep made sure the lover knew
the sorrow of what he put her through
and beg for pardon, for what he did to you
because his feelings were both deep & true

and now, the creep, alone he weeps
his feelings void, not true, not deep
that vile lowly shadow creep
how splendid is his misery to me
